## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned about the property grid-auto-flow. It allows you to determine the way the cells in a grid arange themselves.

### Continued development

I think I have to be more aware of the accesibility issues regarding anchor tags.
